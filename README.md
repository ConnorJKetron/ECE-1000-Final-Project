## Automatic Plant Watering System

### Project Purpose
This project was created to assist in watering plants. It can be difficult to know when to water a plant, which can lead to the plant's death either by overwatering or dehydration. With this system, the need to guess when a plant will need water is eliminated, and the user will only need to refill the reservoir when it is empty.

### Project Functions
This system is comprised of a raspberry pi pico connected to a soil moisture sensor, a relay, and a submersible water pump. When the soil moisture sensor detects that the moisture level is too low, it turns on the raspberry pi's onboard LED and sends a signal to the relay to send 5V to the water pump, which will send water to the plant. Once the soil has reached the desired moisture level, the pump will turn off and the onboard LED will turn off.
